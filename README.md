# amadeus
As the initial stage for building an AI similar to Amadeus, we are collecting simple programs that take some input and give some output based on some logic.

A valid program can be as simple as adding two numbers in C to complex as a console game.

We will use these programs to train the bot ultimately creating a real life Amadeus

Happy Coding... :)
